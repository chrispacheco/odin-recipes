<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese. BONUS: it’s make-ahead and freezer-friendly!</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ tsp pepper</li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently.</li>
