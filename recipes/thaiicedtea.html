<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Easy Thai tea recipe tips are below. Also, weâ€™ve updated this Thai iced tea recipe with an organic tea bag option and with coconut milk!</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup (80 g) Thai Tea Mix</li>
    <li>4 cups (960 ml) water</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup (240 ml) half and half (approximately)</li>
    <li>ice</li>    
</ul>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bring water to boil and add the thai tea mix. Add sugar and gently stir to completely dissolve sugar. Gently boil tea for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Allow tea to steep for at least 30 minutes and allow it to cool. The more concentrated the tea flavor, the better the Thai tea tastes.</li>
    <li>If you are using the Thai tea mix, strain the tea leaves (we love using these reusable cloth filters). Set finished Thai tea aside to cool. You can make this ahead of time and have the Thai tea chilling in the fridge. We usually like to make this tea mix one day ahead.</li>
    <li>Fill glasses with ice and pour in Thai tea leaving enough room to fill in your half and half (or other creamer). For an 8 oz. glass we like to add about 2-3 tablespoons of half and half for a creamier flavor.</li>
</ol>
